                <h3>ABOUT US</h3>

                <p>Swift Reporting Software is an LLC based in Southern California, which provides
                report-writing programs and service, as well as comprehensive libraries for
                professionals.</p>

                <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
                
                <p>Our mission and our vision is to design products that sell themselves, because of
                their excellence, and to continue to provide products and services that are simply
                the best, and which serve the small business owners who fuel the national economy,
                drive the free-enterprise system, and serve the common good.</p>
                
                <h3>OUR SOFTWARE</h3>
                
                <p>Our software is so easy to use and so adaptable that it can be used in any endeavor
                in which inspections are performed or data is gathered and stored for distribution.
                They’re faster than similar programs and include thousands of industry-standard
                narratives from which users can pick-and-choose, edit, and add, to create
                professional reports that can be printed on-site, e-mailed, posted on the Internet
                for distribution, or stored for future use. The software and its libraries were under
                development for more than three years before the corporation was formed or the
                products were marketed. The software is based on years of field experience, as
                well as experience in the design of data-gathering and report-writing programs.
                Consequently, our software exemplifies the latest in technology--in speed and ease
                of use. Similarly, the thousands of industry-standard narratives in the libraries were
                based on years of field experience, and were systematically entered into a data-base
                and refined over a three year period in which the latest codes and safety regulations
                were taken into account. They’re not perfect, nothing of human origin ever is, but
                they’re indisputably the most comprehensive in the industry.</p>
                
                <h3>THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE BEHIND OUR SOFTWARE</h3>
                
                The guiding principle behind out software and what distinguishes it from similar
                products is the melding of computer science and communication skills with more
                than twenty years of field experience that led us to the conclusion that effective
                communication is always plain and simple. When it comes to communication, computers are analogous to human consciousness inasmuch as they're a mechanism
                of storage and retrieval and capable of recall. Similarly, computer language is
                analogous to human language, inasmuch as it's not universal and is extremely
                complicated and evolving. It's only really understood by a select group, but with the
                right application it can result in products that not only serve communication but
              require little or no technical knowledge or skill.<br><br>
                
                <h3>OUR PROMISE TO YOU</h3>
                
                <p>Even though at the moment of writing, we believe that our products and services are
                the best available they’ll continue to improve, spurred by the needs of our clients,
                the pursuit of excellence, and advances in technology.</p>
                
                <h3>COSTS & SERVICES</h3>
                
                <p>Recognizing that money fuels the economy and that the end-users of our products
                are mostly working class people who cannot afford expensive programs, we’ve
                priced ours below those of comparable worth, and we also offer a variety of purchase
                and lease options. These views are shared by the staff of Swift Reporting Software,
                who have similar beliefs and who’ve dedicated their futures to that of the company.
                Service is as important as products and Swift Software prides itself on offering live
                technical support, by which we mean people talking to people and not people talking
                to machines. This does not mean that we provide live service twenty four hours a day
                seven days a week, which is commonly associated with companies that outsource
                services to different countries in different time zones. You’ll come to know us by our
                first names, but our staff is committed to providing friendly live service during regular
                business hours, seven days a week in the Pacific Standard time zone. Calls will be
                returned promptly, and your satisfaction is absolutely guaranteed.</p>
                
                <h3>OUR MARKETING PLAN</h3>
                
                <p>Our marketing plan is simple and dependent on word of mouth, in other words on
                the best form of marketing. We believe in a timeless truth attributed to the famous
                American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, which reads in part: "If a man makes a
                better mousetrap than his neighbor, the world will make a beaten path to his door.”</p>
