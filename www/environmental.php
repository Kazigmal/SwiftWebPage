            <img src="images/epa.jpg" alt="epa" class="floatRight" height="150"><h2 class="alt"><strong>Swift Environmental Library</strong></h2>
            Swift Environmental has the  largest and most comprehensive library of any report-writer in the industry,  and can be used by a single individual, such as a mold specialist, or by  a corporation with a team of scientists and environmental hygienists. The program  was based on a decade of research, including information from the United States  Environmental Protection Agency and industry sources. It includes literally  thousands of narratives designed to be selected, edited, or deleted and  replaced, and to be pre selected to appear automatically in reports, to inform  and educate clients.</div>
            <div class="box"><img src="images/mold1.jpg" alt="mold1.jpg" class="floatLeft" height="150">It goes without saying that environmental  contaminants are not only complicated and counted in the hundreds of thousands,  but this does not mean that the program is complicated. It isn't. For instance,  it can be used to report on the presence of mold in a single-family residence,  or on hundreds of theoretical contaminants in commercial or multi-purpose  buildings. Environmental inspections are not intended to simply identify one  possible contaminant but to assure clients that many others are not present. The  selection process is what controls the activity and the report. It’s as simple  as 1-2-3, and completely under the control of the user. This means that the  program and the reports that it produces can be customized. What a boring place  the world would be if there was one type of house, one type of tree, one type  of person, and one type of report, for which reason we don’t dictate, we  facilitate.</div>
            <div class="box"><img src="images/lab.jpg" alt="Lab Testing" class="floatRight" height="200">The program not only facilitates  the inspection procedure but documents the chain-of-command of samples as well  as remediation and post-remediation services. This is necessary for legal  reasons, and essential for any endeavor involving human health. For the same  reasons, the inspection protocol includes documenting a Client Interview, which  typically defines the parameters of an inspection and limits liability. Regardless,  because of the complexity of the subject it was necessary to divide it in order to  make it manageable. The process is standard and scientific but not immutable  and can be changed by the user. The first division is Indoor Air Quality, which  has administrative aspects and includes a Description of Service, Protocol, and  a Proposal. This is followed by the sub-divisions: Bio-Contaminants, Carbon  Monoxide, Mold and Fungi, Water Quality, Radon Gas, Lead Paint, Asbestos, Volatile  Organic Compounds, and Electro-Magnetic Radiation. Each of these includes:  General Information, Testing and Sampling, and specifically the technique, and Remediation,  each of which generates a list of industry-standard narratives for every  predictable or common occurrence. The extensive library even includes narratives  for such esoteric compounds as the sulfur dioxide that’s allegedly generated  and released by Chinese drywall, and some equally esoteric compounds such as  Meruliporia Incrassata, more commonly known as Poria, or Poria Incrassata,  which is a water-conducting fungus known as the house-eating cancer that  appears and destroys wood in a relatively short time and drips an eerily amber  or blood-like fluid.</div>
            <div class="box">Regardless, every program should  be given a fair trial and compared to others. After this, it’s simply a matter  of becoming familiar with it, taking advantage of everything that it has to  offer, and being assured that live technical support is just a phone call away  for anyone in our family of users. </p>
